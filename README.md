# Java: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures I've implemented throughout my academic and professional journey. The focus is on correct, readable Java code, not optimization. Each component is tested and, unless specified, considered reliable.

## Contents

So far, the repository includes:
- Linked List

As more data structures and algorithms are implemented, I'll update this list and the corresponding documentation.
